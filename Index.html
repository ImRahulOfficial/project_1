            <h2>Introduction to Autotrophic Nutrition</h2>
            <p>
                Autotrophic nutrition is a biological process in which organisms synthesize their own food
                from simple inorganic substances. This is primarily seen in green plants, algae, and certain
                bacteria that use sunlight and carbon dioxide to create glucose through photosynthesis.
            </p>
            <p>
                This process plays a crucial role in the ecosystem as it is the foundation of the food chain.
                Without autotrophs, heterotrophic organisms, including humans, wouldn't survive.

            <h2>Photosynthesis</h2>
            <p>
                Photosynthesis is the most common form of autotrophic nutrition. Plants absorb sunlight using
                chlorophyll, found in chloroplasts. The energy from sunlight converts carbon dioxide from the air
                and water from the soil into glucose and oxygen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The general equation is:<br />
                <strong>6CO₂ + 6H₂O + sunlight → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                This not only provides food for the plant itself but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere,
                essential for life on Earth.

            <h2>Structures Involved in Nutrition</h2>
            <p>
                Several plant structures are specifically adapted for autotrophic nutrition:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Act as solar panels, capturing sunlight for photosynthesis.</li>
                <li><strong>Chloroplasts:</strong> Specialized organelles containing chlorophyll where photosynthesis
                    occurs.</li>
                <li><strong>Stomata:</strong> Small pores on leaves that regulate gas exchange (CO₂ in, O₂ out).</li>
                <li><strong>Roots:</strong> Absorb water and minerals essential for the synthesis of glucose.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These structures work together to maintain the plant’s energy cycle efficiently.

            <h2>Real-Life Applications</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding autotrophic nutrition has several practical applications:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Improving plant nutrition increases food production and quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Science:</strong> Helps manage ecosystems and tackle issues like climate
                    change.</li>
                <li><strong>Biotechnology:</strong> Used in creating genetically modified crops with improved nutrition.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Green Energy:</strong> Biofuel production often relies on algae and plants that are
                    autotrophic.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These insights support sustainable development and food security across the world.
